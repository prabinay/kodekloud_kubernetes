1. Inspect why the POD is not running.
Run the command kubectl describe pod

2. Deploy weave-net networking solution to the cluster.
NOTE: - We already have provided a weave manifest file under the /root/weave directory.
Deploy weave
Wait for the app to run

solution:
Please check out the official weaveworks GitHub page for various weave releases, available at the top right panel.
Run the below command to deploy the weave on the cluster: -

kubectl apply -f /root/weave/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
Now check if the weave pods are created and let's also check the status of our app pod now:

root@controlplane:/# kubectl get pods -A | grep weave
kube-system   weave-net-q7m6s                        2/2     Running   0          21s

root@controlplane:/# kubectl get pods
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app    1/1     Running   0
