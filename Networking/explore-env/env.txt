1. What is the Internal IP address of the controlplane node in this cluster?  
Run the command: kubectl get nodes -o wide and look for IP assigned to controlplane node.  

2. What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the controlplane node?  
Run the ip a / ip link command and identify the interface.  
Run: kubectl get nodes -o wide to see the IP address assigned to the controlplane node.  
In this case, the internal IP address used for node for node to node communication is 10.3.116.12.

Important Note : The result above is just an example, the node IP address will vary for each lab.

Next, find the network interface to which this IP is assigned by making use of the ip a command:  
Here you can see that the interface associated with this IP is eth0 on the host.  
 

3. What is the MAC address of the interface on the controlplane node?  
Run the command: ip link show eth0

4. What is the IP address assigned to node01? 
Run the command: kubectl get nodes -o wide and look for IP assigned to node01 node.  

5. What is the MAC address assigned to node01?
SSH to the node01 node and run the command: ip link show eth0.

6. What is the state of the interface cni0?
Run the command: ip link show cni0 and look for the state.

7. If you were to ping google from the controlplane node, which route does it take?
What is the IP address of the Default Gateway?
Run the command: ip route show default and look at for default gateway.

8. What is the port the kube-scheduler is listening on in the controlplane node?
Use the command: netstat -nplt

9. Notice that ETCD is listening on two ports. Which of these have more client connections established?  
Run the command: netstat -anp | grep etcd  

Correct! That's because 2379 is the port of ETCD to which all control plane components connect to. 2380 is only for etcd peer-to-peer connectivity. When you have multiple controlplane nodes. In this case we don't.
