1. What is the user used to execute the sleep process within the ubuntu-sleeper pod?  
Run the command: `kubectl exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami` and check the user that is running the container.  

2. Edit the pod ubuntu-sleeper to run the sleep process with user ID 1010.  
To delete the existing ubuntu-sleeper pod:  
`kubectl delete po ubuntu-sleeper`  
After that apply solution manifest file to run as user 1010  
Then run the command kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml to create a resource.  
NOTE: TO delete the pod faster, you can run kubectl delete pod ubuntu-sleeper --force. This can be done for any pod in the lab or the actual exam. It is not recommended to run this in Production, so keep a note of that.
